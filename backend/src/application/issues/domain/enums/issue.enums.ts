 * original task/bug enum homes so there is a single source of truth during the
 * migration.
 *
 * NOTE (cleanup): when the old `tasks`/`bugs` modules are retired, move those enum
 * *definitions* into this file and repoint the few external importers (teams,
 * roadmaps, activity, backfills). Re-exporting keeps them from drifting until then.
